### ðŸŒ± About Me
I am currently enrolled in the ALX Frontend Development Program and building the fundamentals needed to become a professional frontend engineer. I am committed to learning clean coding practices, developing a strong debugging mindset, and growing into a developer who creates elegant, user-centered interfaces.

My learning style is **visual, structured, and iterative**, which means I excel when knowledge is built step by step with real-life connections and hands-on practice.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Learning in Progress (Current Stage)
I am still in the **foundations stage** of the program, focusing on:
- Understanding how frontend development fits into the bigger software ecosystem
- Building engineering habits (focus, iteration, debugging thinking, problem-solving)
- Learning structured workflows & development environments
- Preparing for HTML/CSS/JavaScript fundamentals

This journey is about building a **solid base** so I can create real-world, impactful projects later on.

---

### ðŸ§­ Roadmap â€” My Growth Path
1. **Foundations (current):**
   - Engineering mindset, structure, environment, problem-solving
2. **HTML & CSS (up next):**
   - Semantic structure, responsive layout, accessibility
3. **JavaScript:**
   - Interactivity, logic, browser APIs
4. **React & frontend architecture:**
   - Components, state, UI patterns
5. **Portfolio & real user-facing projects**
6. **Professional specialization later (not locked to a niche yet)**

---

### ðŸŽ¯ My Focus Right Now
- Becoming consistent with daily practice
- Strengthening structured thinking
- Building comfort with tools and workflow
- Preparing to transition into coding fundamentals
